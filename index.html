        <p>The way you set up VSC is you first have to download it on the website, then you have to create a folder, then you click "file" up the tp and open folder, find your folder. Once opened right click the middle bit and then create a file for HTML,CSS and JS, then you are ready to code.</p>
        <p>The console screen is for where if you have a problem you can say console.log and then you can find where it is going wrong, the way you can open it is you right click then go down to inspect and then up top you have console click then and you have the console screen.</p>
